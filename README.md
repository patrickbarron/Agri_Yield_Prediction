# Crop Yield Prediction - Kaggle Competition

This project aims to predict the yield of Maize crop using soil and weather data.

- **Best Model** Tuned XGboost
- **Private RMSE** 435.94
- **Public RMSE** 446.30

## Project Structure
- 'Yield_Predictions_Notebook.ipynb': Main Project Notebook
- 'requirements.txt': Requirements to run Notebook
- 'submission.csv': Final Predictions submitted to Kaggle 

## Key Findings
- Tuned XGBoost provided strongest predictions, tuning improved notably
- Both XGBoost and RandomForest outperformed tuned ANN with basic structure
- Tricky dataset to identify relationships between yield and other variables
